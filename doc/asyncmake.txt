==============================================================================
1. Overview					*asyncmake-overview*

The asyncmake plugin allows you to run make in the background. The make output
is processed as it becomes available and added to a quickfix list. You can use
the Vim quickfix commands to browse the output.

This plugin will run only on Vim 8.0 (patch 1040) and above.

==============================================================================
2. Installation					*asyncmake-installation*

You can use any one of the Vim plugin managers (dein.vim, pathogen, vam,
vim-plug, volt, Vundle, etc.) to install and manage this plugin.

Alternatively, you can also manually download and install the plugin.
To manually install the plugin, download and install the following files in
the $HOME/.vim or $HOME/vimfiles directory:

	plugin/asyncmake.vim - async make command definitions
	autoload/asyncmake.vim - autoloaded async make plugin file
	doc/asyncmake.txt    - documentation (help) file

To uninstall the asyncmake plugin, either use the uninstall command provided
by the plugin manager or manually remove the plugin/asyncmake.vim,
autoload/asyncmake.vim and doc/asyncmake.txt files from the $HOME/.vim or
$HOME/vimfiles directory.

==============================================================================
3. Usage					*asyncmake-usage*

To start make in the background, run the following command:
>
	:AsyncMake
<
This invokes the program set in the 'makeprg' option in the background. The
results are processed and added to a quickfix list. Only one instance of the
make command can be run in the background at a time. Arguments passed to the
":AsyncMake" command will be passed on to the external make command:
>
	:AsyncMake -f SomeMake.mak
<
To display the status of the currently running make command, use the
following command:
>
	:AsyncMakeShow
<
To cancel the currently running make command, use the following command:
>
	:AsyncMakeStop
<
When a make is running in the background, if you quit Vim, then the make
process will be terminated.

The output from the make command is added to a quickfix list. You can use the
quickfix commands to browse the output. If the make command exits with an
error code, then the quickfix window is automatically opened.
